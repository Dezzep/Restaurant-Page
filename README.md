# Restaurant-Page
Restaurant page strictly created using JS + styled with CSS.

Things I've learnt from this project:

	- web packs are AWESOME!
	- tried to set up my code for reusability. 
  	although setting up took me a little while, I think creating my own modules will be worthwhile in the long run, reusing code will save me a lot of time! 

- Becoming more proficient at using the Javascript to create elements. 	++ organization.
  For example: I used a for loop that scans an array of arrays the first element of the array J[0] becomes the header, j[1] a paragraph and so on.
